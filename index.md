Welcome to our website for our DATA 2040 Midterm Project! 

We are graduate students at Brown University performing machine learning techniques to classify the Bengali language, as part of the [Kaggle Competitione](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bengaliai-cv19). 

For a presentation of our process and results, check out the following screencast (link) and Github Repository (link).
