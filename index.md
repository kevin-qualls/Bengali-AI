# Bengali Grapheme Classification: Assessing the Challenge
### Blog Post 1  -  Feb. 18, 2020

# Introduction
While being spoken by more than 200 milion people, Bengali language is particulary interesting from the point of view of AI handwritten recognition. Each bengali letter consists of 3 parts -one of 168 possible grapheme roots, one of 11 possible vowel diacritics and one of 7 possible consonant diacritics. The sheer number of combinations makes handwritten symbol recognition a challenging machine learning problem.

At a high level, we are tasked to break down a Bengali word and assign its pieces into 3 bins, shown below:
