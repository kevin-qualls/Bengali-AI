# Bengali Grapheme Classification: Assessing the Challenge
### Blog Post 1  -  Feb. 18, 2020

# Introduction
While being spoken by more than 200 milion people, Bengali language is particulary interesting from the point of view of AI handwritten recognition. Each bengali letter consists of 3 parts -one of 168 possible grapheme roots, one of 11 possible vowel diacritics and one of 7 possible consonant diacritics. The sheer number of combinations makes handwritten symbol recognition a challenging machine learning problem.


At a high level, we wish to break down an image of a Bengali word and assign the pieces to three bins:

Although it's a steep task, our team is prepared and has prior experience with image classification, working with the renowned MNIST Dataset (shown below) to organize numbers by different fonts:

# Loading the Data

There are approximately 10,000 grapheme images to work with. 

We will mostly be using the .parquet train and test files, each of which contains tens of thousands of images (size 137 x 236). Each row represents an image, and we plotted one row as a test:

This image looks similar to the 94th grapheme root, in the table below:

# Neural Network Model 
We attack this problem by designing a deep convolutional neural network of the following form ...
